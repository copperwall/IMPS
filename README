# IMPS is a simple MIPS Emulator project written in Java for my CPE 315 Computer Architecture course.

IMPS is pretty simple at the moment, as it only supports around 10 MIPS instructions right now, but I plan to add more as time goes on. IMPS also emulaes register pc state, and can accept input from stdin or a script file.

## Building:
   'make'

## Usage:
   
   ### Without script file (stdin):
      
     '''shell
      java Imps [ASM_FILE]
     '''

   With script file

   '''shell
    $ java Imps [ASM_FILE] [SCRIPT_FILE]'
   '''
